# Pneumonia_classification

This notebook will show you how to use CNN to classify case of pneumonia from chest-X ray images from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/download) .  
It contains 5856 greyscale scans with various size.  
To classify these scans, we will use Transfer Learning with an EfficientNetB0, that will then be Fine Tuned to improve even more our results.  

Our solution obtain a recall and a precision of about 0.98 on the test set.
